# LibTemplatePlaceholder

Welcome to **LibTemplatePlaceholder**. This repository serves as a template to create repositories used to build Android libraries. This file will guide you through that process, that is defined by two sequential steps:

1. Use the current repository as the template for the new one.
2. Clone the new repository on our machine.
3. Run a script that updates the created repository with the correct information.

These steps are detailed in the next sections. 

:warning: Every step listed here must be successfully completed before you start working on the new repository.

## Create a Repository Based on the Template

First, we need to create a new repository. To accomplish this, please press the **Use this template** button available on the repository's GitHub webpage.

Next, we have to define the new repository's name. In order to get the maximum performance of the following step, we advise you to use the **[ProjectName]Lib-Android** format for the name. The names used for the **Health and Fitness** and the **Social Logins** are valid examples of the expected format (_OSHealthFitnessLib-Android_ and _OSSocialLoginsLib-Android_ respectively).

The following image shows an example of the creation of a repository for the Android' Payments Library.

After filling up the form as needed, the last step to effectively create the repository is the click on the **Create repository from template** button.

## Clone the New Repository

After completing the previous step, the next one is something common done in every repository a developer needs to do work on: clone the repository on the local machine.

## Run the **generator_script.sh**

To finish the process, we just have one last thing to do. Run the **generator_script.sh** script that automates a couple of changes we need to apply. It is included in the _scripts_ folder.

To run the script, please execute the following commands on **Terminal**:

```
cd scripts
sh generator_script.sh
```

Here's the complete list of what the script does:

- The script provides a bit of information, such as mentioning the name that it will use as the Library name (its based on the one you used while creating the repository on GitHub).
- Requests the user for the application's package identifier. The format required is provided and needs to be complied with in order to advance.
- It informs that the script itself will be deleted, as it is a one time execution only.
- It performs the needed changes, replacing all placeholder's organisational identifier and library name for the ones provided by the user.
- To conclude, the script commits and pushes the changes to the remote repository.
